              <p>
                I am an industrial design engineer with extensive knowledge in design methodology
                 and product development.
                I work in an engaged and iterative manner because I am a strong believer
                of continuous improvement. Some of my strengths are keeping customers in
                focus and usability in mind. Iâ€™m interested in user interaction and user
                experience and I always think about usability when developing services and products.
                I also have a great interest in project leadership and agile product
                development such as Scrum. I am self-taught in VBA-programming to be able to
                create project-follow up and forecasting tools and easy to use spreadsheets.

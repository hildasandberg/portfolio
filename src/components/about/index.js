            <p>
              I am an industrial design engineer with extensive knowledge in design methodology
               and product development.
              I work in an engaged and iterative manner because I am a strong believer
              of continuous improvement. Some of my strengths are keeping customers in
              focus and usability in mind. Iâ€™m interested in user interaction and user
              experience and I always think about usability when developing services and products.
              I also have a great interest in project leadership and agile product
              development such as Scrum. I am self-taught in VBA-programming to be able to
              create project-follow up and forecasting tools and easy to use spreadsheets.

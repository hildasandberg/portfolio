Since the liver support system is connected to the patientsâ€™ blood, it is important that the materials being used are biocompatible and able to be sterilized multiple times. Other important requirements for the casing are ergonomically factors such as soft shape, weight and size. \n \n The casing consists of two halves that are assembled using a snap fit. Between the two parts there is a seal that prevents leakage. The bio artificial liver support device is attached to the body using a strap. The casing is designed with smooth and round shapes to feel comfortable against the body and because sharp edges and corners have been avoided, it is also easy keep clean. \n \n CAD: Solid edge Rendering: Keyshot",

The initial phase was followed by three iterative loops with customer interactions, insight analysis, ideation and conceptualization. Customer insights and concepts have been tested, evaluated, and deepened during the project. In the last phase the result was processed and the insights were rated for easier implementation. \n \nA major problem area for many customers was the Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi range, because the technology is perceived as difficult and abstract. The conclusion is that Telia should help their clients to improve the Wi-Fi quality and the project work led to three ultimate concepts tested on customers. Also six recommendations were delivered to Telia. \n \nMethods: Qualitative Interviews, Trigger material, Co-creation, Customer Journey Maps",

//     description: "People with liver diseases sometimes use liver support systems. In this project a casing for such a device was designed. \n \n It is an extracorporeal device with a cryogel matrix containing liver cells. The blood is perfused through the cryogel and then led back into the body and the blood system. Since the liver support system is connected to the patientsâ€™ blood, it is important that the materials being used are biocompatible and able to be sterilized multiple times. Other important requirements for the casing are ergonomically factors such as soft shape, weight and size. \n \n The casing consists of two halves that are assembled using a snap fit. Between the two parts there is a seal that prevents leakage. The bio artificial liver support device is attached to the body using a strap. The casing is designed with smooth and round shapes to feel comfortable against the body and because sharp edges and corners have been avoided, it is also easy keep clean. \n \n CAD: Solid edge Rendering: Keyshot",

The objective of this work has been to deliver useful customer insights and improvement proposals. \n \nIn the project, a service design methodology was used where the focus has been on interactions with customers. The initial phase was followed by three iterative loops with customer interactions, insight analysis, ideation and conceptualization. Customer insights and concepts have been tested, evaluated, and deepened during the project. In the last phase the result was processed and the insights were rated for easier implementation. \n \nA major problem area for many customers was the Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi range, because the technology is perceived as difficult and abstract. The conclusion is that Telia should help their clients to improve the Wi-Fi quality and the project work led to three ultimate concepts tested on customers. Also six recommendations were delivered to Telia. \n \nMethods: Qualitative Interviews, Trigger material, Co-creation, Customer Journey Maps",
